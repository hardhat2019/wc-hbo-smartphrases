HBOT complications paragraph and HBOT paragraph
(sometimes they call it differently; same paragraph)
M?? is an appropriate candidate for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as ?? has failed to respond to appropriate treatment and there have been no measurable signs of healing for at least 30 consecutive days.  Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy would be an essential adjunct in the resolution and treatment of this patient's presenting problem:??  This patient does have sufficient physiologic and psychological stamina to undergo the rigors of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  As such, I recommend the following: Hyperbaric oxygen treatments at 2.0 ATA in 100% oxygen for 90 minutes per treatment.  ??

I have discussed the possible benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy with this patient.  I have also presented and described the risks including: air gas embolism, pneumothorax, central nervous system and pulmonary oxygen toxicity, flash pulmonary edema, hypoglycemia, reversible visual refractive changes, ear and sinus baro-trauma, and confinement anxiety.  The patient has verbalized understanding of these risks and is still willing to undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The patient understands the significant time and transportation commitment involved in daily treatments of up to two hours' duration and has indicated willingness to commit to this therapy.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
