HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY

INDICATION Diabetic Lower Extremity Ulcer

QUALIFYING CRITERIA

CONSENT
The patient is an appropriate candidate for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as they have failed to respond to treatment and have displayed no measurable signs of healing for at least 30 consecutive days. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy would be an essential adjunct in the resolution and treatment of this patient's presenting problem. The patient does have sufficient physiologic and psychological stamina to undergo the rigors of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Having no absolute contraindications to treatment, I recommend the following: Hyperbaric oxygen treatments at 2.0 ATA in 100% oxygen for 90 minutes per treatment for a total of *** sessions.
I have discussed the possible benefits and risks of hyperbaric oxygen therapy with this patient. These include, but are not limited to: fire, barotrauma of the ears, sinuses, and lungs to include air embolism, pneumothorax, central nervous system oxygen toxicity resulting in seizure, hypoglycemia, cataracts, myopia, exacerbation of congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema, and confinement anxiety. The patient has verbalized an understanding of these risks, the significant time and transportation commitment, and has indicated willingness to commit to this therapy.
