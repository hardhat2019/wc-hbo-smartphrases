This patient demonstrates a compromised flap graft.  The operation resulting in the compromised flap graft was: ***.

The Flap graft is still viable, based on the following criteria:{JMH Single Wild Card:50000::"areas of perfused tissue demonstrated by TCOM measurements","areas of brisk capillary refill","areas of tissue that is pink and warm consistent with viability", "***"}.

Other medical and surgical interventions being used to attempt salvage include:
{JMH Multiple Wild Card:40000::"revascularization","leeches","***"}.

Compromised flap grafts can require on average 15-20 treatments until they are capable of healing spontaneously, i.e. without additional Hyperbaric Oxygen.  The primary effects of HBO are through hyperoxygenation of plasma levels by delivery of oxygen at 2.0 atmospheres absolute (equivalent to 33 Feet of Sea Water) achieving 10-15 times that achievable at normal pressure (i.e. Sea level, or 1.0 Atmospheres absolute).  This results in a reduction of edema (through a 30% reduction in blood flow due to prearteriolar sphincter constriction) as well as stimulation of fibroblasts and angiogenesis, and subsequent improved perfusion.  Reperfusion injury is also blunted through inhibition of ICAM receptors on the PMNs. In the case of flaps in particular, marginal perfusion at the flap edges is improved substantially, preserving marginally viable tissue and supporting healing.
