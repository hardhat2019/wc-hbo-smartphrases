This patient has chronic lower extremity wounds with a clinical diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Although a differential for these wounds remains, I think calciphylaxis is reasonable based on history of ESRD, clinically compatible lesions as well as high serum phosphate. Could consider a biopsy to confirm no alternative diagnosis, however not required for diagnosis.

The use of HBO for calciphylaxis is usually reserved for wounds progressing despite optimal management with wound care and medical therapy including phosphate binders and sodium thiosulfate.

In addition, the evidence for HBO and calciphylaxis is variable. However a case series by An et al (Nephrology 2015, PMID 25707425) reviewed 34 patients, 58% of who had durable healing with HBOT and a recent review in the National Kidney Foundations journal (Nigwekar et al; Am J Kidney Dis 2015; PMID 25960299) recommended HBO as second line therapy for recalcitrant calciphylaxis. It is also reviewed favorably in the UHMS Indications Manual 15th edition.

Calciphylaxis is by definition a disorder of arterioles due to calcification and progressive obliteration and ischemia of arterioles. This qualifies for HBO therapy under ICD I77.9

In the meantime, I suggest maximizing medical therapy:
-continue sodium thiosulfate
-continue tight management of serum phosphate and calcium levels
-continue non-calcium phosphate binders
-consider stopping supplemental vitamin d
-consider starting cinacalcet
