Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a relatively rare emergency and potentially devastating condition of the eye. Patients present with sudden, painless monocular vision loss. The prognosis for visual recovery is poor, and up until recently, no treatment could be offered to restore at least some functional vision to the affected eye.

The retina has the highest oxygen consumption rate of any organ in the body at 13 mL/100 gm per min. Retinal tissue is not tolerant of hypoxia.

Until 2006 when hyperbaric oxygen therapy was approved for treatment of central retinal artery occlusion, ophthalmologists had no treatment options for these patients. It is still a vastly underutilized modality, partially due to lack of availability and lack of knowledge in the ophthalmology community.

Preventing loss of vision in an eye that has suffered a CRAO through the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy requires three things:

The HBOT must be undertaken before irreversible damage to the retina has been sustained -HBOT begun after 24 hours is unlikely to be successful in CRAO, although there are well documented of cases with significant improvement despite delays of several days or more.

The arterial occlusion must be at the level of the central retinal artery and not at the ophthalmic artery level, which precludes flow to the choroidal vessels as well.

Hyperbaric or supplemental oxygen sufficient to 1 maintain retinal viability is maintained, at least intermittently, until the CRA recanalizes (typically hours to days -Duker 1988)
and the inner layers of the retina are again adequately oxygenated through the retinal vessels.

Optimized post-initial HBOT management for CRAO patients who have responded successfully to initial HBOT remains to be defined.
