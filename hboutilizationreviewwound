Hyperbaric Medicine Utilization Review

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
This is a @AGE@ old @SEX@ who is currently being treated in the Hyperbaric unit for a diagnosis of ***. Today presents for scheduled review of interval improvement in symptoms and utility of continuing further hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Interval history since last utilization review:
{No/  **:31982} complications or side effects from hyperbaric therapy
{No/  **:31982} change in vision
{No/  **:31982} change in hearing or ear pain or otic barotrauma
Compliance has been {1:26006}. 

Review of recent medical history and appointments shows {No/  **:31982} relevant changes in medical conditions or test results.

INTERVAL WOUND MEASUREMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

DATE:***		MEASUREMENT(length x width x depth): ***

DATE:***		MEASUREMENT(length x width x depth): ***  


These metrics {Single Wild Card:50000::"demonstrate ","do not demonstrate ","***"}measurable signs of healing, including {JMH Multiple Wild Card:40000::"reduction in the width of the wound","reduction in the length of the wound","reduction in the depth of the wound","visible reduction in amount of necrotic tissue","visible decrease in amount of drainage"} during the prior 30 days of hyperbaric treatment as noted above.


(Compromised flap grafts only):***

THIS WOUND IS A COMPROMISED FLAP/GRAFT.  TCOMS ARE MEASURED AT TREATMENT 16 AND TREATMENT 36 TO EVALUATE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFUSION AS THIS IS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF HEALING FOR THIS TYPE OF WOUND:***

TCOM could not be performed at this time due to:  {Single Wild Card:50000::"patient refusal due to sensitive area","unable to perform due to anatomy","dressing cannot be breached.","***"}

RECOMMENDATIONS

{Single Wild Card:50000::"Patient has shown substantial interval improvement since last review. Patient should continue Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment at this time with re-evaluation after next 10 treatments.",
"Patient has shown minimal interval improvement; however, this is common during initial 10-20 treatments. Patient should continue Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment at this time, with re-evaluation after next 10 treatments.",
"Patient has shown little to no improvement since last review, and additional treatment is not recommended at this time.","***"}
