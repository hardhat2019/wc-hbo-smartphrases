Regarding use of intraocular avastin and HBO: This patient is currently using intraocular avastin (an anti-VEGF therapy) for prevention of progression of ocular disease. HBO therapy promotes VEGF production in direct opposition to the mechanism of Avastin and concomitant use of these therapies is generally considered a relative contraindication. In this case, there is a theoretical risk that HBO could counteract avastin and worsen proliferative vascular retinopathy. One paper (Tran et al, Diving Hyperbaric Medicine 2017 Sep;47(3):203) reports a case of a patient with pre-existing PDR worsening with HBO.  However, this same group observed that none of their multiple patients with NPDR were observed to evolve into PDR.   They also reference a double blind, randomised trial of 15 diabetic patients with both NPDR and PDR, which showed that patients in neither the HBO nor the control arm had evidence of neovascularisation nor worsening of PDR at three-month follow up.  Finally, Drozdov et al ( Journal of Ophthalmology 2022;4:18-22) studied addition of HBO to Eylea (aflibercept), vs Eylea alone, for treatment of patients with NPDR + DME (Ms. Sanchez's diagnoses), and observed increased treatment efficacy and improved visual acuity in the HBO+Eylea group.

In this case, it appears that the risks of theoretical progression of ocular disease could be outweighed by potential benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. These risks were shared with the patient and they agreed to proceed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy while continuing intraocular avastin therapy. We will attempt to contact their ophthalmologist to confirm all members of the patient's care team are aware.
