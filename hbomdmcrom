This infection is refractory to offloading, drainage when feasible, immobilization when indicated and surgical debridement when accessible.  It is also refractory to at least 4-6 weeks of systemic antibiotics.  {JMH Single Wild Card:50000::"MRI","Bone Scan","CT scan","X-ray","***"} has confirmed osteomyelitis on ***.  {JMH Multiple Wild Card:40000::"ESR","CRP", "WBC"} demonstrate(s) elevation, consistent with the osteomyelitis.

Chronic refractory osteomyelitis can require on average 40 treatments until it is capable of healing spontaneously, i.e. without additional Hyperbaric Oxygen.  The primary effects of HBO are through hyperoxygenation of plasma levels by delivery of oxygen at 2.0 atmospheres absolute (equivalent to 33 Feet of Sea Water) achieving 10-15 times that achievable at normal pressure (i.e. Sea level, or 1.0 Atmospheres absolute).  This results in fibroblast and osteoblast stimulation as well as stimulation of angiogenesis, and subsequent improved perfusion.  Bacteriocidal effects are obtained through synergy with antibiotics and increased bone penetration.

In addition to HBO, ongoing bony debridements when possible, and offloading will be imperative.
