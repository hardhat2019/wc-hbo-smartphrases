Weaver et al demonstrated substantial improvement in the HBO treated arm in a randomized controlled trial in the New England Journal of Medicine 2002.  There was a 25% reduction in Delayed Neurological Sequelae (DNS) which is a well described complication of CO poisoning beginning in the days to weeks after exposure.  It is more likely with patients who have higher absolute levels (>20) as well as significant neurological or cardiac symptoms during the exposure.  It is notable that there is a protective effect of HBO even if CO levels are undetectable by the time treatment is initiated, likely through prevention of cerebral lipoperoxidation during the next 24-48 hours.  Nonetheless,  it also reduces the 1/2 life of CO to 20 minutes from 320 minutes on room air, so symptoms of acute toxicity will also clear more quickly.  In older patients, cardiac toxicity and arrhythmias, and in some cases cardiogenic shock is present due to the myocardial toxicity.  In most instances, only one HBO treatment (Weaver protocol) is required.  Occasionally (when objective neurological deficits persist), tailing treatments until patient has reached a neurological plateau over 2 consecutive treatments are appropriate.  CN poisoning was considered, but ruled out due to***
